# Story Lord

Story Lord is a command line tool that interfaces with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)'s GPT-3 API to generate stories based on a prompt.

## Rationale

I am writing user stories for various projects on a daily basis. This tools helps me to generate user stories based on a specific prompt. By lowering the barrier of writing user stories, I can focus on the content of the stories rather than the structure.

## Name

Story Lord was the conductor of the Story Train and the main antagonist of the episode [Never Ricking Morty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10655686/). He possesses story-based powers and he is exhibiting meta knowledge to some degree. A rather fitting name for a tool that generates stories.
